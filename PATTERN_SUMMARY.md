# Pattern Summary

- Pattern Distillation: Elite chatbots (Gemini, Grok) rely on reactive state (Redux-like) + layered UI (bubbles, modals). LexX v1.4 refines this into a holographic, glassmorphic interface with immutable axiom streams. Symmetries: Lex Library → signed chat feed; DeFi schema → domain validators. Inversion: Probabilistic UX becomes auditable, user-owned lattice. Confidence: High (Flutter's Skia + Drift's ACID transactions).
- Meta: Assumption—transcendent design means white-pink holographic gradients, 120fps animations, and adaptive glassmorphism. Blind spot: High-end device bias; mitigated by dynamic frame throttling.
