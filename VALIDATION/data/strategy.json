  "goals": "LexX Axiom v1.4 delivers a cross-platform app (iOS, Android, Windows) with unmatched design: white-pink glassmorphic UI, holographic animations, surpassing Tesla Cybertruck aesthetic. Full chatbot parity: real-time chat, voice (STT/TTS), file upload (TXT/PDF), DeFi schema, auditable history. Sovereign: offline, user-signed axioms, no cloud. Outpaces Gemini/Grok via verifiable truth.",
  "risks": "Animation lag on low-end devices: mitigated by adaptive FPS (30/60/120). PDF parsing errors handled by robust chunking and fallback validation.",
  "roadmap": "Deploy v1.4 with elite design. Next: AR document previews or Web3 axiom minting for blockchain provenance."
